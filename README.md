# FHB / For-Homey-Barista. ‚òï

FHB is my First Full-Stack Project that could provide **"Mock" Coffee Brewing Guide** for user want to make great coffee at their own home.</br>
UX is start from _Register User_ and check all the _Brew history_ to end with simple and easy brewing steps with smooth animation.</br>

Through this project I understand **"How"** is data flow between _Client-side_ and _Server-side_(also vice-versa).</br>
Understanding fundermental of Component based library React. How to make smooth and nice animation and layout in CSS.</br>
<br>

## Features üß∞

#### ‚≠ê Brewing guide steps.

- Provide a few steps for daily brewing coffee with UI in each different page.
- **Tried to connect user's focus on page by page or button by button to move to next step.**

#### ‚≠ê Nice and smooth animation.

- Smooth slide animation with SVG file, Made with keyframe function in CSS.
- I believe nice animation or well-designed button are powerful tool for better user experiences.

#### ‚≠ê History and Customizing

- User's brew recipes automatically saved in database and easily check anytime also can customize details of each of them.
- **Personalizing with Customizing details is the strong motivation that users can visit this web-app again**
  </br>

## Refinements üî•

#### üòé UI & Ux / Responsive Web Design

- For this project, I made the design on my own. In that process I felt I need to learn or at least understand how to make a good UI and connect to good UX as well.
- Things are like **Wireframing / Prototype / Fundamental principles of UI**

#### üòé Reusability and Readability of coding

_Making heavy component and many boilerplates is are clear things to improve. Now I strongly aware putting the things are bewlow_

- Right amount of functions or codes in each component.
- Modulate APIs or requests.
- Using right Javascript method(map, switch, for) for dry code.
- Understanding of modern CSS layout(grid and flexbox).

#### üòé Gloabl State Management

- Sorting all the state managing globally or locally.
- I used Redux in this web project but I also learned about using context API with Memo. Then it's powerful and handy to managing global state.

## Why do I choose to do this project and journey summary üö¢

After learning the fundamental skills of front-end web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.</br>
I aimed to delve into the basic mechanisms of how websites function. It was during my daily coffee rituals that inspiration struck.</br>

First, I embarked from very simple project that like a coffee idea generator. </br>
But I wanted to expand my project more like a user **_interactive_** website.</br>
Then I added functions like brewing guidance / personalize system / saving the data in DB so user could check their brew data anytime.</br>

But unfortunately, I faced a hurdle in incorporating actual brewing guidance due to the steep learning curve and the significant time </br>
investment required to gather and present detailed coffee brewing information.</br>
So I decided use **Mock data** for all the brewing guide steps.
</br>
</br>

## What did I learn and What problems I solved ‚ùì

#### Understood

- Basic React mechanism: Hooks, Lifecycle, virtual DOM, Pure function component</br>
- Responsive web concept, modern CSS layout and Mobile first Approach</br>
- Firmly understand of basic **data-flow** between Front-end and Backend through coding APIs and requests.</br>
- Git: How to resolve merge conflicts with **3 way merge / Rebase**

#### Solved Problem

- Errors and infinite loop from misunderstoood of lifecycle of React: I put right dependency to useEffect.
- Mobile First Approach with responsive web: understand the difference between relative unit and fixed unit</br>
  And use minimum mediaquery property instead of maximum property.
- Errors in the process of Deployment: I Got some Cors errors from server side and got some type error from the client side as well</br>
  And the biggest problem is can't chare the cookies between different domain because I deployed Heroku for my server.</br>
  There is 3 solution I researched</br>

  1. Set **PROXY** server.
  2. Buy custom domain for server.
  3. Save JWT in database instead of cookie.
     \*\*\* Problem solving with one of the options...
